/*
Primary colors go to the “hot spots” on your web page. 
You should use these bold, vibrant colors to attract users’ attention and prompt them to take action. 
CTA buttons, headlines, benefits icons, download forms, and other important information should be highlighted using primary colors. 
*/
/*
Secondary colors are used to highlight the less important information on the website, 
such as secondary buttons, subheadings, active menu items, backgrounds, or supporting content like FAQs and testimonials.
*/
/*
Neutral colors will most likely be used for text and background, 
but could come in handy in particularly colorful sections of the site, 
just to help tone it down and refocus the eye.
